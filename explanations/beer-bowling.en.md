# Beer Bowling

## Setup:
- Two teams with two persons on both teams.
- At least one judge.
- 4 chairs.
- 1 football (or something like it).
- 2 empty bottles or canes

## The game
The teams switch bowling to to turn over the target-bottle of the other team. If the bottle turns over they have to share a beer. Normally we play best of 5 and then switch sides and do best of 5 again.

The judge controlles the game and has the power to make rules, give permision and give sips. He also has to make a name for himself.


## Rules:
If the rules are broken, the judge will give sips.

The players have to ask every time they do anything, especially "permission to bowl" is important.

Airball: when a player bowls, the ball has to touch the ground before the middle of the field.

Players have to bowl on the inside of their chairs.

There is a invisible fence between the two target-bottles, which you have jump over.


## Special rules:
The judge decide who wins, the losers get sips.

Sex position: both teams have to make a sex position.

Movie scene: both teams have to make a moviescene of a famous movie.

Swede: both teams have to turn over the opposite team's target and return to their chairs. The first team back in their chairs wins.

Spears: the players has to lay on the ground, the first team to lay on the ground wins.

Captain morgan: all players have to stand with one foot on ground and one foot on the chair, like the pirate on the "Captain Morgan"-bottles

Medic: if a player gets hit by the ball and the judge calls medic, his teammate has to safe him like some kind of doctor and give him some beer.

Stylecard and dumbcard (the direct translation): if a team does something cool and extraordinary they get a stylecard.
If a does something extraordinary bad, they get a dumbcard.
If a team gets 3 stylecards, they can make the other team share a beer in a funny way. If a team gets 3 dumb cards, the other team can make this team share a beer in a funny way.

Sniper: you can ask permission to make an airball, where the ball should hit the target directly without touching the ground. If the player doesn't succeed, he/she gets sips.

These are the basic rules, you can add your own rules :) when you play, it is important that the judge is strict, innovative and doesn't misuse his power.
