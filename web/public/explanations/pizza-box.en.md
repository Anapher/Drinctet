# Pizza Box
What do you need?

- a pizza box or something equal
- a pen
- a quarter

You start with a pizza box or broken down beer case, and every player writes his/her name on the cardboard and draws a circle around it.
The starting player tosses a quarter onto the box. If it lands on somebody's name, that person has to drink and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the quarter lands on a blank spot, the player writes a rule in that location and draws a circle around it--making as big or small as desired. If someone lands their quarter in a rule circle they have to do that rule.
Each person gets one quarter flip per turn, and then you continue to the next person. You keep going until the box is filled with rules. The rules usually continue to get more and more creative, anywhere from "shotgun a beer" to "call another player's mom".
