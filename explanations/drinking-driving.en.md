# Drinking and Driving
What do you need?

- Wii with Mario Kart

You and your friends each have to finish a beer during a race of Mario Kart. The catch is that you canâ€™t have your hands on the controller while drinking. So you can pause throughout, down it immediately, or try to stop right before the finish line and chug before someone sneaks up behind you.
