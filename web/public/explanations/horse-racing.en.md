# Horse Racing
What do you need?

- a card deck
- a crazy moderator

Lay out the Aces of each suit one above the other on the table vertically, shuffle the rest of the deck and set aside. Each of the suits is a "horse." Name each horse. Each person in the room bet a certain number of drinks, maybe between 1 and 5, on the horse (suit) they think will win. Proceed to flip the top card of the remaining deck and place the card beside the Ace of the corresponding suit. Do this again and again until one horse (suit) has reached 10 cards, meaning it has won the race. Anyone who bet on that horse (suit) dishes out the amount of drinks they bet, and anyone who bet on another horse takes the amount of drinks they bet. Collect all the cards except the Aces, shuffle, and repeat. Make sure you get someone who can sell the excitement of the race as they flip the cards. A room full of drunk people get pretty rowdy as horses gain and lose the lead.
